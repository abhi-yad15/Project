# Project
Lungs Cancer Detection:
Worked on Detection of Lung cancer utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with strategically designed convolutional layers, max pooling layers ,dense Layer 
and fully connected layers in Deep Learning.Diligently trained the model on an incrementally refined dataset of  chest X-ray images , 
successfully achieved a 98% accuracy in differentiating between cancer and normal lung tissue.
